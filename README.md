# D3 Times




## Background: 
Using data collected from https://factfinder.census.gov for 2014 ACS 1 year estimates, we have visualised the relationships between age and the percentage of people showing as living in poverty. The data will be shown using an interactive bubble shart that will have pop up labels to show you exact data information if required. 



## Methodology: 

1. Create HTML and CSS files with layouts and stylings that will hold the visualisation.   

2. Create javascript where you set the chart size, append the chart to the html, retrieve the data and then add the circles and labels.

## Results

As we can see in the visualisation above, West Virginia has the median age of 41.9 showing a high poverty rate of 18.3%, Therefore we can conclude they have the highest 
rate of poverty for the oldest age bracket recorded. Mississippi on the other hand is showing highest poverty rate of 21.5% with the median age of 36.7.
