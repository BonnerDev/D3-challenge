## Background: 
Using data collected from https://factfinder.census.gov for 2014 ACS 1 year estimates, we have visualised the relationships between age and the percentage of people showing as living in poverty. The data will be shown using an interactive bubble shart that will have pop up labels to show you exact data information if required. 



## Methodology: 

1. Create HTML and CSS files with layouts and stylings that will hold the visualisation.   

2. Create javascript where you set the chart size, append the chart to the html, retrieve the data and then add the circles and labels.
